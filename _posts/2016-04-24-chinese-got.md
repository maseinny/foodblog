<h3>Home-cooked Chinese Meal & GOT</h3>
<p>So for my meal this week, I got a little help from a friend. She had a recipe from her grandmother for Shanghainese Drunken Chicken (醉雞) that she had never tried making before because it was a little intimidating. So she asked if she could come over and we could make it together. I invited her over on Sunday to cook. </p>
